# gatsby-plugin-directory-named-index

A gatsby plugin wrapping
[directory-named-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/shaketbaby/directory-named-webpack-plugin)

allowing you to have the following file structure:

`src/components/MyComp/MyComp.js`

and yet import your files like:

```javascript
import MyComp from '../src/components/MyComp'
```

making editor tab management and clarity simple without cluttering
your file tree with unnecessary stuff.
